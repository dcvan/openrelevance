Doohan :calls for upgrade to 1000cc bikes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Four-time world 500cc motorcycling
champion Mick Doohan has called for the establishment of a new
1000cc class, featuring four-stroke engines, to replace the
existing machines.
	   Doohan, who was second behind Spanish teammate Alex Criville in
Sunday's 500cc French Grand Prix, believes a move to 1000cc
four-stroke machines would attract new manufacturers such as BMW,
Ferrari and Ford to grand prix racing as engine builders and
suppliers.
	   The 500cc class is the top division for motorcycle racing, but
Doohan said the two-stroke V4 machines raced by Japanese
manufacturers Honda, Yamaha and Suzuki for the past 15 years faced
a limited future.
	   ``It seems to me the two strokes are reaching the end of their
era because the 500 V4s have been doing the same lap times for the
past five years,'' Doohan said Monday.
	   ``We're not making leaps and bounds forward anymore, the bikes
never really change, and people lose interest. There's been talk
about switching to four-stroke grand prix bikes and I think it
would be awesome to go to a 1000cc prototype.''
	   Doohan said changing up to 1000cc bikes with light, small
engines would make the sport more interesting, and more fun for the
riders.
	   ``Going to four-stroke prototypes would take the sport to the
next level and open up racing to other manufacturers like BMW, or
even Ford and Ferrari to build engines,'' Doohan said. ``Yamaha
made Formula One engines even though they don't build cars so it
could work the other way around.''
	   Doohan, who has won 48 grand prix races from 126 starts in the
500cc class since 1989, said a move to 1000cc four-stroke machines
would be expensive, but the benefits would justify the costs.
	   ``Racing four-strokes would cost more, but the manufacturers
aren't afraid to spend if it will do them good,'' Doohan said.
``It's no use trying to keep it cheap because this isn't club
racing. If some people can't afford to run four-stroke grand prix
bikes there's plenty of other championships for them to race in.''

Red Sox beat Yankees 13-7, Mariners defeat Devil Rays 11-6

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Boston Red Sox scored 11 runs in the third
Sunday, then had to rely on a sensational stop by rookie second
baseman Lou Merloni to beat the Yankees 13-7 Sunday.
	   Boston sent 16 batters to the plate in the inning, combining
nine hits and three walks _ plus three poor fielding decisions _
against Andy Pettitte (6-5) and Darren Holmes.
	   Nomar Garciaparra and Jason Varitek each had a double and single
in the majors' biggest inning this season.
	   Pedro Martinez (6-1) turned over an 11-4 lead to the bullpen
with two outs in the sixth.
	   The Yankees scored three times in the seventh to make it 11-7
and had the bases loaded before second baseman Merloni made a
diving stop of a grounder to rob Jorge Posada of a two-run single
and start an inning-ending double play.
 &UR; Mariners 11, Devil Rays 6 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, the Seattle Mariners went the
equivalent of nearly three games without a home run, then hit six,
including Ken Griffey Jr.'s 19th.
	   Rob Ducey ended a 26 2-3 inning drought with a homer leading off
the fourth against Rick White (0-1). Joey Cora, Edgar Martinez,
Russ Davis and David Segui also homered before Griffey finished the
power surge with a solo shot in the eighth off Albie Lopez.
	   Bill Swift (4-3), pitching a day ahead of schedule because Jeff
Fassero had a stomach virus, held the Devil Rays to three runs on
four hits in 5 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Rangers 9, Orioles 5 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Juan Gonzalez hit his seventh career grand slam
and added a solo shot for his second straight two-homer game, to
lead Texas.
	   The five RBIs gave Gonzalez nine in two games and an AL-best 71
in just 54 games. Gonzalez's grand slam came in the third inning
off Scott Erickson (5-6) and gave the Rangers a 5-1 lead.
	   Kevin Elster also homered for the Rangers, who gained a split of
the four-game series. Darren Oliver (3-5) allowed three runs and
seven hits in five innings, and Tim Patterson got four outs for his
first save.
 &UR; White Sox 8, Tigers 2 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Jim Parque pitched 6 1-3 shutout innings in his
second major league start and Chicago hit three home runs for the
win.
	   Wil Cordero, Mike Caruso and Frank Thomas homered for the White
Sox, who gained a split of the four-game series with just their
fourth win in 10 games.
	   Parque (1-0), a left-hander who a year ago was pitching for UCLA
in the College World Series, allowed four hits and three walks.
	   Detroit's Damion Easley went 0-for-4, ending his AL season-best
hitting streak at 19 games.
	   Frank Castillo (2-3) took the loss.
 &UR; Indians 8, Blue Jays 3 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Cleveland scored four runs off Pat Hentgen in the
fourth inning and Charles Nagy (7-2) pitched 6 1-3 solid innings
for his fourth straight win.
	   Jim Thome and Mark Whiten hit solo homers and David Bell and
Omar Vizquel had RBI singles in the fourth off Hentgen (7-4).
	   Carlos Delgado put the Blue Jays up 2-0 in the first with a
433-foot (132-meter) home run to right center.
	   Jose Mesa pitched the final two innings for his first save.
 &UR; Angels 6, Twins 5 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Jason Dickson, an All-Star starter last season,
allowed two hits in 4 1-3 innings of relief before Gary DiSarcina's
sacrifice fly in the ninth lifted Anaheim.
	   Dickson (4-4), a 13-game winner in 1997, is now 2-0 with a 1.42
ERA in five relief appearances since being demoted from the
rotation on May 5. Troy Percival got his 14th save.
	   Justin Baughman tripled off Greg Swindell (0-2) leading off the
ninth and DiSarcina followed with his sacrifice fly to right field.
	   Angels starter Jack McDowell allowed 10 hits and five runs in
just 3 2-3 innings in his second start since coming off the
disabled list.
 &UR; Royals 10, Athletics 4 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Dean Palmer homered and Terry
Pendleton and Mike Sweeney each had two hits in a seven-run seventh
inning for the Royals.
	   The Royals had a season-high 16 hits, including eight against
five pitchers in the seventh when they turned a 4-2 deficit into a
9-4 lead.
	   Jeff King and Johnny Damon added solo homers for Kansas City to
make a winner out of starter Tim Belcher (4-6).
	   The loss went to T.J. Mathews (3-4), who walked the only batter
he faced in the game.

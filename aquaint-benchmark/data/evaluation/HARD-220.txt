<title> Future of Mid-East Peace </title>

<descr>
How have elections and other events affected the future of Mid-East peace politics?
</descr>
      
<narr>
On May 17, 1999, Ehud Barak was elected Prime Minister of Israel. Stories
related to the election, commentaries on the future of Israel and Mid-East
peace, and statements by Ehud and other statesman about the future of peace in
the Mid-East, are on-topic. Documents dealing simply with acts of violence
in the region, with no mention of how it affects the peace situation, are
off-topic.

<title> National Leadership Transitions </title>

<descr>
Which nations experienced transfers of power from one head of state to another and by which methods did these transfers occur?
</descr>
      
<narr>
Articles dealing with military coups, elections and resignations leading to the installment of new leadership in individual nations are considered acceptable. I would prefer documents that make mention of the causes underlying the various shifts in power, but sources treating elections not at the head-of-state level would be considered off-topic.

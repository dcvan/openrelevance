<desc>
What have countries or groups of people done to protect animals
in recent years?

<narr>
All new laws passed in 1999 to protect animals, and all efforts made
by the government or by people to protect animals are on topic.  All
personal reasons behind the protection of animals (like elections), that
contributed to set new animal's protection's laws are off-topic. But reasons behind a law that a govenment put to protect animals are on topic.

<narr>
Articles about efforts to develop schools around the world are
on-topic. The efforts do not have to be only in developing the education:
they can also be in developing the school buildings, the medical
department, or anything related to the school. Information about cultural
differences that affect the development of schools are on topic. Articles
that give statistics and do not explain how they will develop schools are
off-topic.

</descr>
      
<narr>
Articles that address the following issue are on-topic. 
On December 17, 1999, UNSCOM was replaced by the United Nations Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and ordered Iraq to allow
inspections teams immediate and unconditional access to any weapons sites
and facilities, which Iraq rejected. Additionally, information about the
disarmament crisis itself and the ways UNMOVIC has caused the situation to
change are on-topic, as are articles about why UNSCOM was replaced by
UNMOVIC. Documents restricted to UNSCOM, however, are off-topic.

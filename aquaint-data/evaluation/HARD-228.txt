Does gender affect how children interact with one another during group play activities?
</descr>
      
<narr>
Articles relating to children playing with each other with a
focus on gender dynamics are on-topic such as male/female roles perceived
in adolescants. Documents regarding general group
behavior are off-topic, as are ones dealing specifically with
different play activities by children. Search should focus on the gender aspect
of children's interactions with one another and not their surrounding
environment. Documents from academic studies on children are acceptable,
while response observations are not.

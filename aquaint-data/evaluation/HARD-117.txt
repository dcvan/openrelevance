<title> US Civil Unrest </title>

<descr>
How was civil unrest in the US tackled by local authorities
and police in the last year?
</descr>
      
<narr>
Documents related to the measures taken by the police to handle
the civil unrest (curfews, etc.), especially in Seattle at the WTO talks,
extent of damage due to the riots, news articles on the arrests of those
involved, slow progress of the WTO talks in the wake of the riots are
on-topic documents. Additionally, any information about other incidents of
civil unrest/disobedience are on-topic, if they specifically address the
way authorities tried to control the situations. Articles concerning
similar incidents outside of the US are not on-topic.

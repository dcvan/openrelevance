<narr>
Articles related to West Nile virus, RMSF and Lyme disease warnings
are on-topic. Information about how people live during the summer months
(barbecue, etc) and how this has changed due to fear of tick- and
mosquito-borne diseases are on-topic. Stories about similar diseases
outside of the US are off-topic.

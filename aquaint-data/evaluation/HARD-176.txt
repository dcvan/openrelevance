<title> Geo-Politics of War </title>

<descr>
How has war in the past decade helped shape geo-political
boundaries of conflicting nations?
</descr>
      
<narr>
Articles about war or military conflict between countries are
on-topic as long as they include the resulting geo-polital boundary of each
involved party. Articles that show statistics of war are not
on-topic. Articles about countries threatening others of waging wars
against them are off-topic.

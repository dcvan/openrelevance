<title> Efficiency of computer operating systems </title>

<descr>
How does efficiency compare among current computer operating systems?
</descr>
      
<narr>
On-topics include only current personal computer operating
systems. Prefered documents include statistics on system crashes, bug
reports, user reviews, and consumer reports. Documents dealing with the
financial status of leading computer companies and engineers are off-topic,
as are operating systems for embedded devices, and OSes still in
development phases. Search should return information
concerning how completed OSes compare/contrast each other.
